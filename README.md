# CombiLP

## About

This repository contains a re-implementation of the CombiLP algorithm in Python.
The original implementation was done by Bogdan Savchynskyy and has been
[integrated into opengm][opengm]. I rewrote the whole C++ code base to clean
everything up and implemented some major improvements (see references).

You can find more information on the [project's website][website].

Note that this is the not the code used the latest paper, but it should be
comparable and much easier to use and hack on, see next section.


## Requirements

  - Python 3
  - numpy
  - opengm (optional: to load opengm hdf5 model files)
  - subsolvers you want to use (most of the included as submodule, CPLEX is
    optional dependency)
